# first downloaded the tle data from celestrak, but the years didn't match the cpf data online (2005-2023), so downloaded data from Space track website
# preprocessed the data and stored in a csv 
# made _netrc for downloading the cpf files directly from the website , instead of doing manually
# downloaded 2005 data manually
