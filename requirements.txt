# first downloaded the tle data from celestrak, but the years didn't match the cpf data online (2005-2023), so downloaded data from Space track website
# preprocessed the data and stored in a csv 
# made _netrc for downloading the cpf files directly from the website , instead of doing manually
# downloaded 2005 data manually


## 5/11:
# the data is stored in data.csv and cpf_files folder
# the final model is ann_train_two.py file
# the entire final dataset and the results are stored in outputs_final folder
# === Overall Results ===
# err_x: MAE=2701.241, RMSE=4740.090
# err_y: MAE=5481.882, RMSE=6604.528
# err_z: MAE=225.675, RMSE=237.574
